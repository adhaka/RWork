"This is an original shed allotted to our family firm by the government in 1963. This is a freehold property. There are no bank or other encumbrances.  The sale is due to retirement of  the managing partner. It is possible to conclude a quick clean deal .

The shed is located in the prestigious phase 3  of okhla industrial estate, The first industrial estate in india. The estate is gated with only about 27% of the 200 acrs of land as built up.There are divided internal roads with flowering trees in the middle making the estate very environmentally attractive. The estate is very well maintained and clean.

Our shed is a part of four sheds joined together on a large 2000 sq m plot. This shed is in the south west corner with a main road on the west and a side road on the south. The building overlooks the vast national small industries corp. Ltd.(Nsic) grounds on the west looking towards nehru place and the famous bahai temple. The nsic grounds are separated by the estate wall. Thus no future construction can come up opposite the building.

It would be prudent for the buyer to pull down the old structure and rebuild a building according to his needs with modern design and materials. Unfettered sunlight from south and west would facilitate the use of solar energy. The  delhi masterplan 2021 is applicable at this time. It permits an far of 1.5. However if there is amalgamation with either the north or the east neighbour so that the plot size bocomes more than 1000 sq m the far automatically becomes 2.25. Due to the new metro lines near the estate  from badarpur and noida the far is likely to go up to 4.0 in the near future as per the proximity to mass transit lines norms.

At present the govindpuri metro station on the badarpur-Central secretariat line is operational and is only 5 minutes walking distance away. Very soon( By about 2014 end) a new station will open near the estate main gate on the noida line. This is about 10 minutes walk away. The okhla railway station is about 15 minutes walk away. There is no dearth of bus stops and auto rickshaw availability in the vicinity.
The estate has an active association with most occupants as members.The notable among the owners are the luxor group, The contol & switchgear group., The kashyap group etc. Many automobile companies have their showrooms and workshops here prominent among them  are maruti, Toyota, Volvo, Hyundai, Mercedes etc.
Punjab national bank, Dena bank, Hdfc and sbi have large branches here.
Other well known companies such as bharti airtel, Ndtv, Ptv, Mirchi radio, Leo burnett, O & m advertising, Rolls royce, Hari bhakti consultants, Span exports, Amarchand mangaldass, Dhl, Dainik jagran, Cafe coffee day ,Etc maintain  a large presence here. Some foreign companies have also opened there bpos here."
